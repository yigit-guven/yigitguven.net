  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Squad Bot values your privacy. Here’s how we handle data:</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Squad does not collect or store any personal data outside Discord servers. All actions occur within your server and your Discord environment.</p>

    <h2>2. Message Data</h2>
    <p>Messages sent in channels or via bot commands are processed temporarily to perform the requested actions. None of this data is saved on external servers.</p>

    <h2>3. Member Information</h2>
    <p>Squad only accesses member information necessary to perform its functions, such as usernames or roles, but does not store or share it externally.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Squad does not use external analytics or tracking tools. No third-party service receives your data from the bot.</p>

    <h2>5. Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. Continued use of Squad indicates acceptance of any updates.</p>
